    <title>Efficiently Modeling Long Sequences with Structured State Spaces</title>
    <summary>  A central goal of sequence modeling is designing a single principled model
that can address sequence data across a range of modalities and tasks,
particularly on long-range dependencies. Although conventional models including
RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers have specialized variants for capturing long
dependencies, they still struggle to scale to very long sequences of $10000$ or
more steps. A promising recent approach proposed modeling sequences by
simulating the fundamental state space model (SSM) \( x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t),
y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t) \), and showed that for appropriate choices of the state
matrix \( A \), this system could handle long-range dependencies mathematically
and empirically. However, this method has prohibitive computation and memory
requirements, rendering it infeasible as a general sequence modeling solution.
We propose the Structured State Space sequence model (S4) based on a new
parameterization for the SSM, and show that it can be computed much more
efficiently than prior approaches while preserving their theoretical strengths.
Our technique involves conditioning \( A \) with a low-rank correction,
allowing it to be diagonalized stably and reducing the SSM to the well-studied
computation of a Cauchy kernel. S4 achieves strong empirical results across a
diverse range of established benchmarks, including (i) 91\% accuracy on
sequential CIFAR-10 with no data augmentation or auxiliary losses, on par with
a larger 2-D ResNet, (ii) substantially closing the gap to Transformers on
image and language modeling tasks, while performing generation $60\times$
faster (iii) SoTA on every task from the Long Range Arena benchmark, including
solving the challenging Path-X task of length 16k that all prior work fails on,
while being as efficient as all competitors.
